Repo for my final year project "Development of A Robotic Guide Dog".\
The objective of this project is to develop a robotic guide dog that has similar functions to a real guide dog, therefore making guide dog services more accessible to the visually impaired. [More details](https://centilinda.github.io/portfolio/fyp.html).\
The robot platform is Unitree A1 Robot Dog. I used a Jetson Nano to run all the codes.\
All the software tools I used are well-maintained and open-source. This project is meant to be a proof-of-concept development.
